<h1>HTML Mini-Project</h1>
<p>This is basically a trial and error rundown of the functions of HTML and CSS inline when used on the Github repository site, on a website.</p>

<h2>To begin the discoveries of the HTML tag functions, I want to start off with the basics.</h2>
<p>The first instructions of HTML I am going to demonstrate will be "expressive" abbreviations/functions of HTML.</p>

<h3>These are the basic "expressive" functions which are presented at the top of the list of HTML tag functions.</h3>

<p><strong>This is the function of "Strong" text that is used to grab the readers or website audience's attention when the phrases on the screen need to be read with a sense of urgency for the readers attention to be grasped.</strong></p>

<p><i>This is an example text of the "Italic" function that is used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, or a though, etc.</i></p>

<p>The next expression is called "Strikeout" or "Del" - <del>The function looks like this</del>.</p>
